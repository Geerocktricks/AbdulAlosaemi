        <h3>Chapter 4 - Blockchain Developer Interview</h3>
        <p>To better understand blockchain, I spoke with Fredrik Grimmenhag, a swedish software developer who
                works for Das Ortliche, a german technology company.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in crypto and blockchain. What is your level of knowledge on this topic?</p>
        <p><b class="tetxt-muted">Fredrik:</b> I mean if you are lucky they (crypto consumers) have some more knowledge than me, but it's
            probably doubtful. The technology while awesome is niche and quite young.</p>
        <p>Describe your experience with blockchain technology.</p>
        <p><b class="tetxt-muted">Fredrik:</b> The concepts, yes, writing one, kinda yes but no, more than an end user perspective like a lot of
                us have.</p>
        <p>What advantages does blockchain have over current technology?</p>
        <p> <b class="tetxt-muted">Fredrik:</b>The advantage is the security and working peer to peer, which means that it's detached from a
                single company/bank/etc, while still not allowing people to do whatever they want.
                Cryptocurrency being a good example because it's a value that is without a bank but it's still secure in
                transactions.</p>
        <p>What commercial applications do you see for blockchain?</p>
        <p><b class="tetxt-muted">Fredrik:</b> In the financial sector it's mostly just for currency, there have been attempts to use it for other
                things such as video games but in general it's not very useful outside currencies currently, but it's still
                moderately young technology</p>
        <p>What is your background as a programmer?</p>
        <p><b class="tetxt-muted">Fredrik:</b> I work as a developer/Programmer for a TMS/TA product (Transport management system /
                Transport administration) and we are interested in it but it's hard to adopt (blockchain technology).</p>
        <p>Can you explain?</p>
        <p><b class="tetxt-muted">Fredrik:</b> Because generally you want all your data in a central database. Problem with blockchains being
                that the data is kinda unavailable like, if you have your own bitcoin wallet on your PC, nobody can get it
                unless they get it from there.</p>
        <p>What companies do you see leveraging blockchain successfully?</p>
        <p><b class="tetxt-muted">Fredrik:</b> Unless the business is one like bittrex that is only tangentially related to crypto and then
                tangentially to blockchain.
                It's a niche audience. What i mean is, sure, we have adopted some core principles of blockchain, like
                history being immutable and only adding on instead of changing.
                But we can't do it as a true blockchain.
                it's just a design pattern for ensuring security, minorly adopted but not applicable (wide scale).</p>
        <p>What did you study before working at Das Ortliche?</p>
        <p><b class="tetxt-muted">Fredrik:</b>I mean initially I studied to become a civil engineer, but due to my interest in programming I went in the
                well, software development direction. So I went from hobby developer to developer. All roads lead to
                code started somewhere at age 11 writing shitty game maker games
                I was doing warcMEt 3 GUI long before then but once you go programming, you never go back.</p>
        <p>You have described blockchain as a young technology, do you see blockchain as having problems
                having practical applications outside of cryptocurrency?</p>
        <p><b class="tetxt-muted">Fredrik:</b> Yeah. Trying to invent a problem just to use a solution.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your time!</p>
        <p>Well, I am happy I could help.</p>
