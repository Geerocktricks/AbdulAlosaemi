            <h1>Chapter 3 - Score Base - Reports</h1>
            <p>For Score Base report, 3 white papers were assessed and rated for their viability and a theme emerged over the implementation of blockchain for commercial applications outside of crypto currency.</p>
            <p>The first white paper assessed was MindSync</p>
            <p>MindSync offered an AI oriented GPU/CPU hybrid solution to offload cloud services for AI projects onto their platform. MindSyncâ€™s value proposition was that of less expensive products than currently available.</p>

            <p>The second white paper assessed was Chainlink.</p>
            <p>Chainlink seeks to bridge the gap between inaccessible encrypted information within a blockchain and leveraging it for business contracts. Chainlink is trying to address the core issue with realizing blockchain value other than crypto currencies.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The third white paper assessed was RubyCoin.</p>
            <p>Rubycoin is a crypto currency. The issue with a crypto currency is market share and market adoption. Too much focus has been on launching crypto currencies when users may find centralized crypto vaults too insecure and crypto currencies too hard to manage. DigiCredits would provide a better solution to online transactions because it requires no knowledge of crypto mining and wallet apps.</p>
