    <div class="jumbotron" style="background-image: url(/img/touse.jpg);height: 500px;">
        <h4>Website image here!!!</h4>
    </div>
    <p>Whootels.com was developed from scratch by Evan Briggs using Amazon Web Services and Google Domains for the Digital ENTP skill development purposes of this course. It uses JavaScript and other programming tools.</p>
    <p>To assess the digital commercial viability of Whootels.com, the domain has been purchased and registered with Google.</p>
    <div class="jumbotron">
        <h4 class="text-muted">My Website</h4>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h3>Website image Here!!</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h3>Domain has custom DNS set up</h3>
                <p>Your domain is currently configured in a custom manner. You can configure your domain by navigating tho the DNS page, or you can override this setting by using web forwarding.</p>
                <br><br>
                <hr>
                <a href="">Set up forwarding</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>An affiliate Partnership has been formed with <a href="">Vegas.com</a> to serve their ads on Whootels.com, for possible revenue opportunity.</p>
    <div class="jumbotron">
        <h3>Vegas image here!!</h3>
    </div>
    <p>An advertiser account has been set up with <a href="">CJ.COM</a>, an affiliate network, and applications have been made to host ads for other major hotel booking and travel websites.</p>
    <div class="jumbotron"   style="height: 500px;">
        <h3>CJ.COM image here!!!</h3>
    </div>
    <p>This is until/if Whootels.com becomes acquired by a larger website such as hotels.com, expedia.com, etc.</p>
    <p>While this is unlikely, a venture capitalist may wish to develop the TPI or the domain into a business if sufficient time is spent networking. Contact with Expedia employees as a base of starting point is already established.</p>
    <p>To direct web traffic to Whootels.com (the Amazon servers) custom DNS servers had to be set up and registered with Google</p>
    <p>Domain transfer to Amazon is possible to facilitate development there</p>
    <div class="jumbotron">
        <h3>servers here!!</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Whootels.com runs on an instanced AWS service called EC2, a linux deployment running on the cloud. This allows inexpensive set up of the website.</p>
    <div class="jumbotron">
        <h3>SYSTEM LOG:</h3>
    </div>
    <p>A virtual software package of Bitnami is successfully set up.</p>
    <p>DATA HERE CANNOT BE CAPTURED!!</p>
    <div class="jumbotron">
        <h3>logs here!</h3>
